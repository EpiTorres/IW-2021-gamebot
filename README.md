# GAME BOT: Developing a video game bot to teach machine learning*  

![Here's a dino trained with the Deep Q-Learning algorithm!](/assets/dino_game_dql.gif "Dino with Deep Q-Learning!")

This repository contains my implementation of the Q-Learning and Deep Q-Learning algorithms for
Google Chrome's *Dinosaur Game*. In particular, this implementation served as the basis for my
[guide and starter code](https://github.com/EpiTorres/dino-game-rl).

# Project Acknowledgements

I would like to thank Dr. David Walker and the "You Be the Prof"
Princeton Independent Work Seminar for their support as I developed
this project.

I would also like to thank [Shivam Shekhar](https://github.com/shivamshekhar/Chrome-T-Rex-Rush), 
[Shantanu Bhattacharyya](https://github.com/bhattacharyya/reach_circle), 
[Mauro Comi](https://github.com/maurock/snake-ga),
and [Unnat Singh](https://github.com/unnat5/deep-reinforcement-learning/tree/master/dqn).
This project draws on much of their work and would likely not have
been possible without their amazing tutorials and repositories.
